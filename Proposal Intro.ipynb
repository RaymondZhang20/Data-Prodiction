    "It is without a doubt that tennis is a very popular sport all around the world. There are several huge tournaments that occur yearly such as Wimbledon, US Open, and Australian Open. In the data set that we are working with today, it shows the statistics of the top 500 tennis players around the world. We want to analyze and tidy this data set from the original set so thereâ€™s a clear and concise set of data to use for our project. In our data set we need to tidy the set by highest rank, so number one comes out first and then second and so on. We want to see what percentage of players who are right handed versus the players who are left handed and where they fall on their rankings. \n"
